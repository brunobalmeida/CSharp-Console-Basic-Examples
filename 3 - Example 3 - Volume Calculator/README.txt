Example 3 - Volume Calculator - Console App

Create at least three methods to calculate volume of three objects: sphere, cylinder, and rectangular
prism. Use the formulas provided below to do the calculation.
* Volume of a sphere = 4/3 × pi × radius3
* Volume of a cylinder = pi × radius2 × height
* Volume of a rectangular prism = length × width × height
* PI can be estimated as 3.14159

On the console, ask what type of shape a user wants to make.
Then, show a menu that shows three options 1, 2, and 3.
The user should be able to select one option.

On the console, ask for the appropriate parameter values to calculate the volume of the selected
shape as follows:
A sphere needs only the radius
A cylinder needs a radius and a height
A rectangular prism requires a length, a width and a height

The values should allow for numbers with decimal places for all the shapes.
Using the values as parameters, create three methods to calculate the three volumes.
All three methods should have the same name (Method Overloading). You should follow the
appropriate naming conventions.
