Example 1 - Console Application - Display info

Create a C# console application that displays information about yourself. Your application will display the following when the application is started. Display your name, display your email, display your program name, and a finally display your programming experience (Low, Moderate, or High). Before any of the above information is displayed, also include (display) a title ALSO – remember to do a “Press any key to continue” at the end of the process so that your executable program can be run outside of the programming Studio.
